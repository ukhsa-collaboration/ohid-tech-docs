## Alerting and monitoring

There's a standard set of alarms that are deployed to services. These alarms are defined in the [devops-terraform-standard-alarms](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/devops-terraform-standard-alarms) repo. The deployed alarms use a Lambda which is added automatically to each account via a StackSet. This Lambda forwards alarms to a Microsoft Teams channel. Refer to the [devops-phe-alarms-lambdas](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/devops-phe-alarms-lambdas/) repo for more detailed information on how this works.

## ECS standards

For ECS services, start with the smallest CPU/memory configuration that will run, then resize based on real traffic and telemetry. This keeps costs low and avoids over-provisioning.

## Logging and log retention

Logging is inconsistent across services. Most apps output default framework logs; structured logging is rare which makes CloudWatch harder to use.
