Historically, access patterns were inconsistent (IAM users in some accounts, role assumption via other accounts, etc). We now provision access via IAM Identity Center (SSO).

Users are managed in the `ohid-aws-landing-zone` repository and log in at `https://phe.awsapps.com/start`.

## Identity source

We use the built-in Identity Center directory (not AD / external IdP) so that delivery partners can access AWS without requiring a UKHSA Microsoft account.

## Permission sets

Current permission sets are fairly basic (read-only and admin). As the estate grows, a small set of standard permission sets will help reduce risk while keeping things usable.
