## Networking

Networking is currently created and managed by Terraform inside each workload account. The common result is one VPC per account with its own subnets, NAT gateways, and endpoints.

This is fine for our current scale, but it has trade-offs:
Guidance:

- Keep CIDRs non-overlapping by default. This will allow cross-service networking through a TGW or peering in the future without too much NAT-hackery.
- Prefer VPC endpoints for AWS services to reduce NAT traffic where feasible.

## Terraform state

State currently lives per-account: Terraform creates an S3 bucket for the backend. Optionally, a DynamoDB table is also created but this is no longer necessary with newer versions of Terraform.

One potential improvement would be to centralise backend bucket creation via StackSets/CloudFormation.

## Control Tower logging

CloudTrail and Config are enabled through Control Tower, so logs should already land in the centralised log archive account. 

## DNS

DNS is not consistent today. It’s mostly delegated from `phe-prd`, but the subdomain patterns vary by service.

Service-specific quirks are documented on each service page under `Services`.
