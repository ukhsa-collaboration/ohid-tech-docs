ECS and Lambda application logs are are shipped to CloudWatch Logs and stored in the account running the workload.

## Find the right account

1. Sign in to the OHID AWS organisation.
2. Switch to the service account and environment you need (for example, `Active 10 - Production`).
3. Confirm the AWS region for the service before you search logs.

## Search logs in CloudWatch

1. Open CloudWatch.
2. Go to `Logs` -> `Log groups`.
3. Select the log group(s) for the service you are investigating.
4. Use `Log Insights` to search across the selected log groups.

## Basic Log Insights queries

Find the latest errors:

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /error/i
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 50
```

## Tips

- Start with a short time range, then widen it.
- If you cannot find logs, confirm you are in the correct account, environment, and region.
- Keep searches narrow by selecting only the log groups you need.
- AWS has a few sample queries that you may be able to build off to aid in your queries: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax-examples.html#CWL_QuerySyntax-examples-Lambda
