# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This section captures the current OHID AWS setup and the conventions we try to follow. It’s intended to be practical documentation for day-to-day work rather than an AWS best practices guide.

## Contents

## AWS Overview

Originally, we had three accounts: `phe-prd`, `phe-uat` and `phe-dev`. `phe-prd` currently runs most of the OHID live production workloads but these workloads are slowly being moved to their own accounts.

The new setup is: each service (for example Active 10) gets at least three AWS accounts: Dev, UAT, and Production. These are managed through Terraform in the [ohid-aws-landing-zone](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/ohid-aws-landing-zone) repo. Account Factory for Terraform could be used in the future but may be unnecessarily complex for our scale.
