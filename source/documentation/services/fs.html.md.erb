Food Scanner is an app that allows users to scan food barcodes and log what they've eaten. All three environments (preview, staging, production) follow the same pattern with traffic entering through an ALB and the containerised app running on an EC2 instance.

I haven't been able to find much documentation around this but it seems quite messy.
