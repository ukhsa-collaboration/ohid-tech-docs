## Terraform state

State currently lives per-account: Terraform creates an S3 bucket for the backend. Optionally, a DynamoDB table is also created but this is no longer necessary with newer versions of Terraform.

One potential improvement would be to centralise backend bucket creation via StackSets/CloudFormation.

## Control Tower logging

CloudTrail and Config are enabled through Control Tower, so logs should already land in the centralised log archive account. 

## DNS

DNS is not consistent today. It’s mostly delegated from `phe-prd`, but the subdomain patterns vary by service.

Service-specific quirks are documented on each service page under `Services`.
