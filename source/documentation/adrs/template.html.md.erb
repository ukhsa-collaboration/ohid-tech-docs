Use this template when recording architectural decisions for OHID services and platforms.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: <short decision title>

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Deciders: <names or team>

## Context

What is the context for this decision? What problem are we trying to solve?
Include constraints, drivers, and assumptions.

## Decision

What is the change we are making? Be clear and specific.

## Alternatives Considered

- <alternative 1 and why it was not chosen>
- <alternative 2 and why it was not chosen>

## Consequences

What becomes easier or harder because of this decision?
Include operational, security, and cost impacts where relevant.

## References

- <links to designs, RFCs, diagrams, PRs, or other ADRs>
```

## Guidance

- Keep ADRs short and specific to a single decision.
- Use `ADR-XXX` as the filename prefix, for example `ADR-012-use-rds-proxy.md`.
- Store ADRs in `source/documentation/adrs/`.
- If an ADR is superseded, add a link to the new ADR in the old one.
