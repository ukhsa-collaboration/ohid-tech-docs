# <%= current_page.data.title %>

All of the Mobile Apps follow a broadly similar pattern. It is described below but each app will have slight differences which are documented on their individual pages.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
The only public component. Routes requests to the CMS or NHS login backend based on the Host header.

## Content Management System (CMS)
Django-powered API for in-app content. Content is managed via the Django admin site.

## S3 and Cloudfront
Media is uploaded to S3 via the CMS admin and served through CloudFront.

## NHS login backend
FastAPI service that authenticates via NHS login and provides a user data sync API.

## Redis
Caches token state to enforce single active sessions (i.e. single devices) and prevent sync conflicts.
